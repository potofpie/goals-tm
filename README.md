# Goals TM

### Purpose
> This was inspired by my sister after I had a conversation with her about goal acquisition. While talking to her she showed how she tracks her progress toward her monthly goals. I found the way she visualized her goals very interesting and wanted to make this into a web application. This should also serve as a template of some of my experience as a full stack developer and automation engineer.
