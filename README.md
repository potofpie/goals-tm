# Goals TM

### Purpose
> This was inspired by my sister after I had a conversation with her about goal acquisition. While talking to her she showed 
> how she tracks her progress toward her monthly goals. I found the way she visualized her goals very interesting and wanted 
> to make this into a web application. This should also serve as a template of some of my experience as a full stack  
> developer and automation engineer.
